<h2>ON RUSTIC HUMOUR</h2>

<p>Than the compilation of such a series of books as that which includes
the present volume there could surely be no more engaging occupation for
one who delights to look on the humorous side of life. The editor feels
that if his readers derive as much enjoyment from the result of his
labours as these labours have afforded him he may reasonably
congratulate them! He has found himself many times over, as a book has
taken shape from his gatherings in the treasure house of Mr. Punch,
saying "This is the best of the lot"&mdash;and usually he has been right.
There is none but is "the best!" There <i>may</i> be one that is not quite so
good as the other twenty-four; but wild horses would not drag the name
of that one from the editor. He feels, however, that in illustrating the
humours of country life Mr. Punch has risen to the very summit of his
genius. There is, of course, good reason for this, as it is notorious
that the richest humour is to be found in the lowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> walks of life, and
flourishes chiefly in rustic places where folks are simple and character
has been allowed to grow with something of that individuality we find in
the untouched products of Nature. Your true humorist has always been in
quick sympathy with the humblest of his fellow men. In the village
worthy, in poor blundering Hodge, in the rough but kindly country
doctor, the picturesque tramp, the droning country parson, the inept
curate, the village glee singers, and such like familiar figures of
rural England, the humorist has never failed to find that "source of
innocent merriment" he might seek for vainly in more exalted ranks of
our complex society. But he seeks among the country folk because his
heart is there. The very best of Mr. Punch's humorists of the pencil,
Charles Keene and Phil May in the past, and Mr. Raven-Hill and Mr. C. E.
Brock to-day, have given more consideration to the country ways of life
than to any other, and hence the exceeding richness of the present
volume. It is thus in no sense a comic picture of Mr. Punch's notions of
how the so-called country life is attempted by the townsman&mdash;one of the
most notable features of our present social conditions&mdash;but is, in
effect, a refreshing breath of genuine rustic humour, kindly,
whole-hearted, and "racy of the soil."</p>

<p><i>How to Winnow Corn.</i> <i>1st Method.</i>&mdash;Get some corn. Get somebody who
knows how to winnow it. Let him do it.</p>

<p><i>2nd Method.</i>&mdash;If <i>you</i> know all about it, do it yourself.</p>

<p><i>3rd Method, for Beginners, given in Agricultural Terms.</i> Place a
steward near the blower, and let him drive the blower while the hopper
is filled with a large wecht. (This is called the system of
<i>Hopper</i>-ation.) Then let a woman with a small wecht slide down on a
wheel crushing the blower with her shoes. This should be done in a neat,
cleanly way until the scum has been swept with a besom through a wire
screen, while another lot go on riddling, when it is the duty of the
fanner to answer each riddle as it comes out. The fanner's chief work
is, however, to prevent any labourer becoming too hot. When a labourer
is very warm, he sits down before the fanner, who soon restores him to
coolness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p><i>How to Pickle Pork.</i>&mdash;Get the hog into a proper temperature. To bring
this about make him swallow a small thermometer. This'll warm him. Rub
him with paper dipped in oil, give him a uniform coating of barley, tar,
syrup of squills, pitch, and gold tin-foil. Paint his head green with
orange stripes, and by that time he'll be in a pretty pickle.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;Always visit your poultry yard before breakfast. If unable
to find a fresh egg, go to the cattle sheds. Remember that, where eggs
cannot be obtained, a <i>yoke</i> of fine oxen beaten up with a cup of tea is
most invigorating.</p>

<h2>HORTICULTURE UP TO DATE</h2>

<p>Stimulated by the recent achievements of a horticulturist, who is about
to place on the market the "pomato," a blend of the apple and tomato,
and the "plumcot," a mixture of plum and apricot, <i>Mr. Punch</i> hopes soon
to be able to announce the successful rearing of the following
novelties:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Cumberry.</i>&mdash;This may be regarded either as a very long gooseberry
or a very short cucumber, according to fancy. When fully ripe the skin
is thin and the contents pulpy. Unripe it is like a cobble, and may be
used as such. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is disposed to think that the over-ripe
cumberry will be very popular at elections, especially when eggs are
scarce. The hairy variety looks like a fat caterpillar, and makes very
good grub.</p>

<p><i>The Mistletato</i>, a happy combination of the romantic and the domestic.
This fruit, which has a very piquant flavour, has been grown in a small
patch of soil, concealed, like King <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, among the branches of an
oak. Hence it is not surprising that the Mistletato should combine the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>nourishing qualities of the homely tuber with the sentimental
associations of that plant which was revered by our Druid ancestors and
is beloved by modern maidens. It should be a popular dish at wedding
breakfasts.</p>

<p><i>The Pumpkonion</i> promises well and seems likely to combine the amplitude
of the pumpkin with the pungency of the onion. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is of opinion
that a machine will have to be invented for dealing with this vegetable,
as to handle it would be too severe a tax upon the cook's lachrymal
glands.</p>

<p><i>The Turniparrot</i> and the <i>Parsniparagus</i> are not yet sufficiently
developed to be described with any confidence. Many others are only in
an incipient state at present, but <i>Mr. Punch</i> hopes to be able before
long to announce that he has brought several to maturity, including the
Collage and the Cabbyflower.</p>

<h2>THE FARMING OF THE FUTURE;</h2>

<span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>A Car on an Electric Light-railway.</i><br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>The Twentieth Century.</i></center><br />

<p><i>First Farmer</i> (<i>recognising Second Farmer</i>). Why, 'tis Muster Fretwail,
surelie! didn't see it was you afore. And how be things gettin' along
with <i>you</i>, sir, eh?</p>

<p><i>Farmer Fretwail</i> (<i>lugubriously</i>). 'Mong the middlin's, Muster
Lackaday; 'mong the middlin's! Nothen doin' just now&mdash;nothen 't all!</p>

<p><i>Third Farmer</i> (<i>enviously</i>). Well, <i>you</i> hevn't no call fur to cry out,
neighbour! I see you've got a likely lot o' noo 'oardins comin' up all
along your part o' the line. I wish mine wur arf as furrard, I know
thet!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Ah, them "Keep yer 'air on" 's, <i>you</i> mean, Ryemouth. I
don't deny as they was lookin' tidy enough a week back. But just as I
was makin' ready fur to paint up "Try it on a Billiard Ball," blamed if
this yere frost didn't set <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>in, and now theer's everything at a standstill
wi' the brushes froze 'ard in the pots!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> 'Tis the same down with me. Theer 's a acre o' "Bunyan's
Easy Boots" as must hev a noo coat, and I cann't get nothen done to 'en
till th' weather's a bit more hopen like. Don' keer <i>'ow</i> soon we hev a
change, myself, I don't!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Nor yet me, so long as we don't 'ave no gales with it.
Theer was my height-acre pasture as I planted only las' Candlemas wi'
"Roopy's Lung Tonics"&mdash;wunnerful fine and tall they was too&mdash;and ivery
one on 'en blowed down the next week!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Well, I 'ope theer wun't be no rain, neither, come to
that. I know I 'ad all the P's of my "Piffler's Persuasive Pillules"
fresh gold-leaved at Michaelmas, and it come on wet directly arter I
done it, and reg'lar washed the gilt out o' sight an' knowledge, it did.
Theer ain't no standin' up agen rain!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> I dunno as I wouldn't as lief hev rain as sun. My
"Hanti-Freckle Salves" all blistered up and peeled afoor the summer was
'ardly begun a'most.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> 'Tis a turr'ble 'ard climate to make 'ead against, is
ourn. I've 'eard tell as some farmers are takin' to they enamelled hiron
affairs, same as they used to hev when I wur a lad. I mind theer wur a
crop o' "Read Comic Cagmag" as lingered on years arter the paper itself.
Not as I hold with enamelling, myself&mdash;'tain't what I call 'igh
farmin'&mdash;takes too much outer the land in <i>my</i> 'pinion.</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Aye, aye. "Rotation o' boards." Say, "Spooner's Sulphur
Syrup" fur a spring crop, follered with some kind o' soap or candles,
and p'raps cough lozengers, or hembrocation, or bakin' powder, if the
soil will bear it, arterwards&mdash;that's the system <i>I</i> wur reared on, and
theer ain't no better, 'pend upon it!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> I tell 'ee what 'tis; it's time we 'ad some protection
agen these yere furrin advertisements. I was travellin' along the Great
Northern tother day, and I see theer was two or three o' them French
boards nigh in ivery field, a downright shame an' disgrace I call it,
disfigurin' the look o' the country and makin' it that ontidy&mdash;let alone
drivin' honest British boards off the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>land. Government ought to put a
stop to it; that's what <i>I</i> say!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> They Parliment chaps don't keer <i>what</i> becomes of us poor
farmers, they don't. Look at last General Election time. They might ha'
given our boards a turn; but not they. Most o' they candidates did all
their 'tisin' with rubbishy flags and balloons&mdash;made in Japan, sir,
every blamed one o' them! And they wonder British agriculture don't
prosper more!</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> Speakin' o' queer ways o' hadvertisin', hev any on ye set
eyes on that farm o' young <span class="smcap">Fullacrank's</span>? Danged if iver <i>I</i> see sech
tom-fool notions as he's took up with in all <i>my</i> born days!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Why, what hev he bin up to <i>now</i>, eh?</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> Well, I thought I shud ha' bust myself larfin' when I see
it fust. Theer ain't not a board nor a sky sign; no, nor yet a 'oarding,
on the 'ole of his land!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Then how do he expect to get a profit out of it?&mdash;that's
what <i>I</i> want to year.</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> You' ll 'ardly credit it, neighbours <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>but he's been
buryin' some o' they furrin grains, hoats and barley, an'
I dunno what not, in little 'oles about his fields, so as to make the
words, "Use Faddler's Non-farinaceous Food"&mdash;and the best on it is the
darned young fool expecks as 'ow it'll all sprout come next Aperl&mdash;he do
indeed, friends!</p>

<p><i>F. Fretwail.</i> Flyin' in the face of Providence, I calls it. He must ha'
gone clean out of his senses!</p>

<p><i>F. Lackaday.</i> Stark starin' mad. I never heerd tell o' such
extravagance. Why, as likely as not, 'twill all die off o' the land
afore the year's out&mdash;and wheer wull he be <i>then</i>?</p>

<p><i>F. Ryemouth.</i> Azackly what I said to 'en myself. "You tek my word for
it," I sez, "'twun't niver come to no good. The nateral crop for these
yere British Hisles," I told 'en, "is good honest Henglish hoak an'
canvas," I sez, "and 'tain't the action of no sensible man, nor yet no
Christian," sez I, "to go a drillin' 'oles and a-droppin' in houtlandish
seeds from Canada an' Roosha, which the sile wasn't never intended to
bear!"</p>

<p><i>Farmers Fretwail and Lackaday.</i> Rightly spoke, neighbour Ryemouth,
'twas a true word! But theer'll be a jegement on sech new-fangled
doin's, and, what's moor, you and I will live fur to see it afore we're
very much older!</p>

<h2>RURAL FELICITY</h2>

<blockquote><p>[This is the second Nature article that has recently arrived at
<i>Mr. Punch's</i> offices through inadvertence. It was obviously
intended for <i>The Country-Side</i>, the new Harmsworth-Robinson
organ, which is designed to bring home to townsmen the wonders
of country life.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Evening in the country! A Spring evening! Ah, you dweller in the close
perfervid city, how I wish I could have transported you to my side
yesterday, while I stood and watched the sinking fire of day (a bright
impulsive fellow this sun) waving me from his Orient window.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">A Glad Good-night!</span></center>

<p>How I wish you could have lain near me on that pile of fresh-cut hay,
redolent of clover and the scarlet vetch, lulled to sleep, it may be, by
the low <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>moaning of rats in the stack, or the melancholy hoot of the night-jar!
Sleep follows swiftly, sleep such as you denizens of the crowded street
can never know&mdash;sleep beneath the stars.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Up with the lark! Shelley's skylark! There he is, the blithe unconscious
creature, hovering above the plough-share, ready to pounce upon the
first unwary field-vole upturned from his</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nest in the Luxuriant Loam.</span></center>

<p>My heart is full to bursting as I pass onward into the harvest-field and
watch the gleaners at their busy toil. For one thing I have my "Topical
Quotations" to prepare, and am "dividing my swift mind" between the
<i>Georgics</i> of Virgil and Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality" for a
suitable selection. Then there are the straw bonnets and rough smocks of
the rustics to be sketched for the fashion-plate, and my column upon the
Insanitary Condition of Birds' Nests to be compiled.</p>

<p>Yet how difficult to fix one's mind upon mere <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>journalism, when on this
side and on that the lithe rabbit is popping up from his "forme," and
beneath their white blossoms the red strawberries lurk under every
springing hedge-tuft. A glass of creamy butter-milk supplied by the
smiling lass at the cottage wicket, together with a light and delicious
scone</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Eaten in the Stubble</span></center>

<p>under the sighing alders, has served me for my simple yet hygienic meal.
And now as I watch the shepherd lead his flock of lowing kine into the
pastures, the stately old bell-wether bringing up the rear, I feel that
here is life indeed, and here (had the exigencies of a week-end return
permitted) I could willingly have spent the remainder of my days, "the
world forgetting, by the world forgot," but inexorable Fate with her
iron shears forbids. I must</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S AGRICULTURAL NOVEL</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">Bo and the Blacksheep.</span><br /><br />

<i>A Story of the Sex.</i></center><br />

<blockquote><p>(<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas of Wessex</span>, <i>Author of "Guess how a Murder feels,"
"The Cornet Minor," "The Horse that Cast a Shoe," "One in a
Turret," "The Foot of Ethel hurt her," "The Flight of the
Bivalve," "Hard on the Gadding Crowd," "A Lay o' Deceivers,"
&amp;c.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>["I am going to give you," writes the Author of this book, "one
of my powerful and fascinating stories of life in modern
Wessex. It is well known, of course, that although I often
write agricultural novels, I invariably call a spade a spade,
and not an agricultural implement. Thus I am led to speak in
plain language of women, their misdoings, and their undoings.
Unstrained dialect is a speciality. If you want to know the
extent of Wessex, consult histories of the Heptarchy with
maps."]</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h3>

<p>In our beautiful Blackmoor or Blakemore Vale not far from the point
where the Melchester Road turns sharply towards Icenhurst on its way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Wintoncester, having on one side the hamlet of Batton, on the other the
larger town of Casterbridge, stands the farmhouse wherewith in this
narrative we have to deal. There for generations have dwelt the rustic
family of the Peeps, handing down from father to son a well-stocked
cow-shed and a tradition of rural virtues which yet excluded not an
overgreat affection on the male side for the home-brewed ale and the
home-made language in which, as is known, the Wessex peasantry delights.
On this winter morning the smoke rose thinly into the still atmosphere,
and faded there as though ashamed of bringing a touch of Thermidorean
warmth into a degree of temperature not far removed from the zero-mark
of the local Fahrenheit. Within, a fire of good Wessex logs crackled
cheerily upon the hearth. Old Abraham Peep sat on one side of the
fireplace, his figure yet telling a tale of former vigour. On the other
sat Polly, his wife, an aimless, neutral, slatternly peasant woman, such
as in these parts a man may find with the profusion of Wessex
blackberries. An empty chair between them spoke with all an empty
chair's eloquence of an absent inmate. A butter-churn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>stood in a corner next to an ancient clock that had ticked away the
mortality of many a past and gone Peep.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.</h3>

<p>"Where be Bonduca?" said Abraham, shifting his body upon his chair so as
to bring his wife's faded tints better into view. "Like enough she's met
in with that slack-twisted 'hor's bird of a feller, Tom Tatters. And
she'll let the sheep draggle round the hills. My soul, but I'd like to
baste 'en for a poor slammick of a chap."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peep smiled feebly. She had had her troubles. Like other realities,
they took on themselves a metaphysical mantle of infallibility, sinking
to minor cerebral phenomena for quiet contemplation. She had no notion
how they did this. And, it must be added, that they might, had they felt
so disposed, have stood as pressing concretions which chafe body and
soul&mdash;a most disagreeable state of things, peculiar to the miserably
passive existence of a Wessex peasant woman.</p>

<p>"Bonduca went early," she said, adding, with a weak irrelevance, "She
mid 'a' had her pick to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
A mampus o' men have bin after her&mdash;fourteen o' 'em, all the best lads
round about, some of 'em wi' bags and bags of gold to their names, and
all wanting Bonduca to be their lawful wedded wife."</p>

<p>Abraham shifted again. A cunning smile played about the hard lines of
his face. "Polly," he said, bringing his closed fist down upon his knee
with a sudden violence, "you pick the richest, and let him carry Bonduca
to the pa'son. Good looks wear badly, and good characters be of no
account; but the gold's the thing for us. Why," he continued,
meditatively, "the old house could be new thatched, and you and me live
like Lords and Ladies, away from the mulch o' the barton, all in silks
and satins, wi' golden crowns to our heads, and silver buckles to our
feet."</p>

<p>Polly nodded eagerly. She was a Wessex woman born, and thoroughly
understood the pure and unsophisticated nature of the Wessex peasant.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Bonduca Peep&mdash;little Bo Peep was the name by which the
country-folk all knew her&mdash;sat dreaming upon the hill-side, looking out
with a premature woman's eyes upon the rich valley that stretched away
to the horizon. The rest of the landscape was made up of agricultural
scenes and incidents which the slightest knowledge of Wessex novels can
fill in amply. There were rows of swedes, legions of dairymen, maidens
to milk the lowing cows that grazed soberly upon the rich pasture,
farmers speaking rough words of an uncouth dialect, and gentlefolk
careless of a milkmaid's honour. But nowhere, as far as the eye could
reach, was there a sign of the sheep that Bo had that morning set forth
to tend for her parents. Bo had a flexuous and finely-drawn figure not
unreminiscent of many a vanished knight and dame, her remote
progenitors, whose dust now mouldered in many churchyards. There was
about her an amplitude of curve which, joined to a certain luxuriance of
moulding, betrayed her sex even to a careless observer. And when she
spoke, it was often with a fetishistic utterance in a monotheistic
falsetto which almost had the effect of startling her relations into
temporary propriety.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h3>

<p>Thus she sat for some time in the suspended attitude of an amiable
tiger-cat at pause on the edge of a spring. A rustle behind her caused
her to turn her head, and she saw a strange procession advancing over
the parched fields where&mdash;[Two pages of field-scenery omitted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>by one they toiled along, a far-stretching line of women sharply defined
against the sky. All were young, and most of them haughty and full of
feminine waywardness. Here and there a coronet sparkled on some noble
brow where predestined suffering had set its stamp. But what most
distinguished these remarkable processionists in the clear noon of this
winter day was that each one carried in her arms an infant. And each
one, as she reached the place where the enthralled Bonduca sat
obliviscent of her sheep, stopped for a moment and laid the baby down.
First came the Duchess of Hamptonshire followed at an interval by Lady
Mottisfont and the Marchioness of Stonehenge. To them succeeded Barbara
of the House of Grebe, Lady Icenway and Squire Petrick's lady. Next
followed the Countess of Wessex, the Honourable Laura and the Lady
Penelope. Anna, Lady Baxby, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Bonduca shuddered at the terrible re-encounter. Was her young life to be
surrounded with infants? She was not a baby-farm after all, and the
audition of these squalling nurslings vexed her. What could the matter
mean? No answer was given to these questionings. A man's figure, vast
and terrible, appeared on the hill's brow, with a cruel look of triumph
on his wicked face. It was Thomas Tatters. Bonduca cowered; the noble
dames fled shrieking down the valley.</p>

<p>"Bo," said he, "my own sweet Bo, behold the blood-red ray in the
spectrum of your young life."</p>

<p>"Say those words quickly," she retorted.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Tatters. "Blood-red ray, Broo-red ray, Broo-re-ray,
Brooray! Tush!" he broke off, vexed with Bonduca and his own imperfect
tongue-power, "you are fooling me. Beware!"</p>

<p>"I know you, I know you!" was all she could gasp, as she bowed herself
submissive before him. "I detest you, and shall therefore marry you.
Trample upon me!" And he trampled upon her.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h3>

<p>Thus Bo Peep lost her sheep, leaving these fleecy tail-bearers to come
home solitary to the accustomed fold. She did but humble herself before
the manifestation of a Wessex necessity.</p>

<p>And Fate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> sitting aloft in the careless expanse of ether, rolled her
destined chariots thundering along the pre-ordained highways of heaven,
crushing a soul here and a life there with the tragic completeness of a
steam-roller, granite-smashing, steam-fed, irresistible. And butter was
churned with a twang in it, and rustics danced, and sheep that had fed
in clover were "blasted," like poor Bonduca's budding prospects. And,
from the calm nonchalance of a Wessex hamlet, another novel was launched
into a world of reviews, where the multitude of readers is not as to
their external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences.</p>

<h2>AT A CATTLE MARKET</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">An Autumn Reminiscence</span></center>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A large open space near a cathedral town. Fat old farmers in
white hats, and smart young farmers in Newmarket coats and neat riding
boots; elderly shepherds in blue, grey, and white smocks. From time to
time there is a stampede of bewildered bullocks, whose hind legs are
continually getting hitched over each other's horns. Connoisseurs lean
over pen-rails and examine pigs reverently, as if they were Old Masters.
Others prod them perfunctorily. The pigs bear these inconveniences
meekly, as part of the penalty of greatness. Sheep look over one
another's shoulders and chew nervously on one side of their mouths.</i></p>
